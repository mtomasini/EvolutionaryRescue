# EvolutionaryRescue
Contains the scripts used for simulations in the paper "When does gene flow facilitate evolutionary rescue?" (Tomasini and Peischl, 2020. Evolution:  https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.14038, bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/622142).

The scripts were never supposed to be released, and I did not take particular care to make them more readable than they are. Please remember that I wrote these scripts during my PhD, and there are a lot of inefficients lines; I learned a lot about Python since then, and would code many things differently nowadays. If a line seems very strange to you, it's probably because I found my own hacks to do things I didn't know I could write better. The scripts are written in Python 3. 

The script 'parameters.py' creates the text file containing all sets of parameters to be tested (just add the parameters you want to test to the lists in the beginning of the script), needed to run 'main_simulation.py'. I added an example of 'parameters.txt' file.  

I also added the R scripts used to generate the figures in the main text. 

For quick inquiries and questions about the code, feel free to open an issue here on github or to DM me on Twitter, @mattomasini; for more complicated questions, please write to Dr. Stephan Peischl (you can find the address in the paper).
