# EvolutionaryRescue
Contains the scripts used for simulations in the paper "When does gene flow facilitate evolutionary rescue?" (Tomasini and Peischl, 2019, bioRxiv: https://doi.org/10.1101/622142))

The scripts were never supposed to be released, and I did not take particular care to make them more readable than they are. They are written in python3. The script 'parameters.py' creates the text file containing all sets of parameters to be tested, needed to run 'main_simulation.py'. For inquiries and questions, feel free to open an issue here on github or to DM me.
